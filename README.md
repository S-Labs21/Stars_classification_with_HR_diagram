# Stars classification and study of Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

**Dataset:** - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepu1109/star-dataset

# Features in the dataset:
1) Absolute Temperature (K) - The surface temperature of a star measured in Kelvin.
2) Relative Luminosity (L/Lo) - The star's brightness compared to the Sun's luminosity (Lo).
3) Relative Radius (R/Ro) - The star's size compared to the Sun's radius (Ro).
4) Absolute Magnitude (Mv) - The star's intrinsic brightness at a standard distance (10 parsecs).
5) Star Color - The visible color of the star (e.g., Red, Blue, White, Yellow, etc)
6) Spectral Class - A classification (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) based on temperature and spectral lines.
7) Star Type **(Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence , SuperGiants, HyperGiants)** - The category of star.

----------------------------------

Note: 
- Intrinsic brightness refers to the true brightness of a star (or any celestial object) as it would appear if viewed from a standard distance of 10 parsecs (about 32.6 light-years).
- Lo = 3.828 x 10^26 Watts (Avg Luminosity of Sun)
- Ro = 6.9551 x 10^8 m (Avg Radius of Sun)
-----------------------

# Purpose:
This notebook uses stars classification dataset to study Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram or simply HR-Diagram for classifying stars and studying stellar evolution.
